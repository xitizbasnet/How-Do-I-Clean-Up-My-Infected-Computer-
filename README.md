How Do I Clean Up My Infected Computer?

If your computer is already infected by bots, protecting your data is the most important thing. Disconnect the computer from the network as soon as possible, which will halt the theft of sensitive information. It also prevents your computer from being used to attack other networks. The next step is moving all important/personal data to another computer or external hard drive—just make certain they’re malware-free first! Once this is complete, you’ll need to clean your computer using assorted security tools, or by having a professional work on the device.

Remember, prevention is the best medicine in regard to bots and all other malware. Stay up to date with your software, never click on anything suspicious, and utilize anti-malware techniques to the fullest extent.
